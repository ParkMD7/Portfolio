This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This prtfolio is still a WIP. I'll eventually get around to hosting it externally but for now you can check out the progress so far by doing the following:

First download the repo.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
